# Installation

## Makefile
- Execute `make run`

## Manual
- Create a python virtual environment with `virtualenv .env`
- Activate venv:
    - In Linux: `source .env/bin/activate`
- Install libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Execute `python3 main.py`

## Problems
- If you had your terminal with spaces, maybe `curses` change configs on your
terminal and didn't close well, just execute `reset` in linux.
